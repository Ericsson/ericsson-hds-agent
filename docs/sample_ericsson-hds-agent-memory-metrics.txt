#metadata Active int The total amount of buffer or page cache memory, in kilobytes, that is in active use. This is memory that has been recently used and is usually not reclaimed for other purposes.
#metadata Active(anon) int The amount of anonymous and tmpfs/shmem memory, in kibibytes, that is in active use, or was in active use since the last time the system moved something to swap.
#metadata Active(file) int The amount of file cache memory, in kibibytes, that is in active use, or was in active use since the last time the system reclaimed memory.
#metadata AnonHugePages int The total amount of memory, in kibibytes, used by huge pages that are not backed by files and are mapped into userspace page tables.
#metadata AnonPages int The total amount of memory, in kibibytes, used by pages that are not backed by files and are mapped into userspace page tables.
#metadata Bounce int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, used for the block device bounce buffers.
#metadata Buffers int The amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes, used for file buffers.
#metadata Cached int The amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes, used as cache memory.
#metadata CommitLimit int This is the total amount of memory in kilobytes currently available to be allocated on the system.
#metadata Committed_AS int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, estimated to complete the workload. This value represents the worst case scenario value, and also includes swap memory.
#metadata DirectMap2M int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, mapped into kernel address space with 2 MB page mappings.
#metadata DirectMap4k int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, mapped into kernel address space with 4 kB page mappings.
#metadata Dirty int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, waiting to be written back to the disk.
#metadata HardwareCorrupted int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, with physical memory corruption problems, identified by the hardware and set aside by the kernel so it does not get used.
#metadata HugePages_Free int The total number of hugepages available for the system. This statistic only appears on the x86, Itanium, and AMD64 architectures.
#metadata HugePages_Rsvd int The number of unused huge pages reserved for hugetlbfs.
#metadata HugePages_Surp int The number of surplus huge pages.
#metadata HugePages_Total int The total number of hugepages for the system. The number is derived by dividing Hugepagesize by the megabytes set aside for hugepages specified in /proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_pool. This statistic only appears on the x86, Itanium, and AMD64 architectures.
#metadata Hugepagesize int The size for each hugepages unit in kilobytes. By default, the value is 4096 KB on uniprocessor kernels for 32 bit architectures. For SMP, hugemem kernels, and AMD64, the default is 2048 KB. For Itanium architectures, the default is 262144 KB. This statistic only appears on the x86, Itanium, and aMD64 architectures.
#metadata Inactive int The total amount of buffer or page cache memory, in kilobytes, that are free and available. This is memory that has not been recently used and can be reclaimed for other purposes.
#metadata Inactive(anon) int The amount of anonymous and tmpfs/shmem memory, in kibibytes, that is a candidate for eviction.
#metadata Inactive(file) int The amount of file cache memory, in kibibytes, that is newly loaded from the disk, or is a candidate for reclaiming.
#metadata KernelStack int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, used by the kernel stack allocations done for each task in the system.
#metadata Mapped int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, which have been used to map devices, files, or libraries using the mmap command.
#metadata MemFree int The amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes, left unused by the system.
#metadata MemTotal int Total amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes.
#metadata Mlocked int The total amount of memory, in kibibytes, that is not evictable because it is locked into memory by user programs.
#metadata NFS_Unstable int The amount, in kibibytes, of NFS pages sent to the server but not yet committed to the stable storage.
#metadata PageTables int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, dedicated to the lowest page table level.
#metadata SReclaimable int The part of Slab that can be reclaimed, such as caches.
#metadata SUnreclaim int The part of Slab that cannot be reclaimed even when lacking memory.
#metadata Shmem int The total amount of memory, in kibibytes, used by shared memory (shmem) and tmpfs.
#metadata Slab int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, used by the kernel to cache data structures for its own use.
#metadata SwapCached int The amount of swap, in kilobytes, used as cache memory.
#metadata SwapFree int The total amount of swap free, in kilobytes.
#metadata SwapTotal int The total amount of swap available, in kilobytes.
#metadata Unevictable int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, discovered by the pageout code, that is not evictable because it is locked into memory by user programs.
#metadata VmallocChunk int The largest contiguous block of memory, in kilobytes, of available virtual address space.
#metadata VmallocTotal int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, of total allocated virtual address space.
#metadata VmallocUsed int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, of used virtual address space.
#metadata Writeback int The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, actively being written back to the disk.
#metadata WritebackTmp int The amount of memory, in kibibytes, used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers.
